NAME

ShiftJIS::CP932::MapUTF - Conversion between Microsoft CP932 and Unicode

SYNOPSIS

    use ShiftJIS::CP932::MapUTF;

    $cp932_string = utf8_to_cp932($utf8_string);

DESCRIPTION

This module provides the following functions:

    cp932_to_utf8()    converts CP932 to UTF-8.
    cp932_to_utf16le() converts CP932 to UTF-16LE (little endian).
    cp932_to_utf16be() converts CP932 to UTF-16BE (big endian).
    cp932_to_utf32le() converts CP932 to UTF-32LE (little endian).
    cp932_to_utf32be() converts CP932 to UTF-32BE (big endian).

    utf8_to_cp932()    converts UTF-8    to CP932.
    utf16le_to_cp932() converts UTF-16LE to CP932.
    utf16be_to_cp932() converts UTF-16BE to CP932.
    utf32le_to_cp932() converts UTF-32LE to CP932.
    utf32be_to_cp932() converts UTF-32BE to CP932.

In addition, the XS version supports these (REQUIRES Perl 5.6.1 or later).

    cp932_to_unicode() converts CP932 to Unicode [*].
    unicode_to_cp932() converts Unicode [*] to CP932.

    [*] .. Perl's internal form. see perlunicode.pod in Perl 5.6 or later.

DEPENDENCIES AND INSTALLATION

XS version:     Perl 5.6.1 or later
Non-XS version: Perl 5.003 or later

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If Perl 5.6.1 or later, XS will be installed.
If you don't have a C compiler, try to install Non-XS as below.

If Perl 5.6.0 or before, XS will be automatically disabled
and Non-XS will be installed.

If you have a C compiler and want to use the XS version,
type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL xs    # something beginning by 'x' is also ok.
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install the Non-XS version after trying to build the XS,
type the following:

   make clean
   perl Makefile.PL no    # something beginning by 'n' is also ok.
   make
   make test
   make install

Note: The file MapUTF.pmN is required to build XS.
      Don't delete it before the install completes.
